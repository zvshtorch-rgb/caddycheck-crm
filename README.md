## Business Rules

### Revenue Calculation

| Maintenance Year | Rate per Camera |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Y1 (first year) | €778            |
| Y2+ (subsequent)| €228            |

Maintenance year is determined by: `invoice_year - installation_year + 1`

The calculation is isolated in `services/invoice_service.py → _determine_maintenance_year()` for easy adjustment.

### Invoice Generation

Generated invoices reuse the template structure from `CC_M_inv_8669_Dec_2025.xlsx`, preserving headers, bank details, and formatting. Projects are included based on matching `payment month` from the Projects overview.

### Debt Calculation

Expected = sum of `num_cams × rate` for each year from `installation_year` to current year.
Debt = Expected − Paid invoices.

## Email Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** page.
2. Enter your SMTP host, port, credentials, and default recipients.
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify.
4. Click **Save Settings**.

For Gmail, use:
- SMTP Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `587`
- TLS: enabled
- Use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) instead of your account password.

---

## Generated Files

All generated files are saved to the `output/` directory:
- Monthly invoices: `CC_M_inv_<number>_<Mon>_<Year>.xlsx`
- Dashboard exports: `CaddyCheck_Dashboard_<timestamp>.xlsx`

---

## Scheduled Monthly Sending

Use `monthly_auto_send.py` to generate and email the monthly invoice automatically on the 1st of the month.

Default behavior:
- If you run it on `2026-05-01`, it prepares and sends the invoice for `April 2026`.
- It uses the configured default recipients and CC addresses.
- It saves invoice rows to the ledger before sending unless you disable that.
- It refuses to resend the same month/year if that month already exists in `config/sent_invoices_log.json` unless you pass `--force`.

Manual test:

```bash
python monthly_auto_send.py --dry-run
```

Live send:

```bash
python monthly_auto_send.py
```

Useful overrides:

```bash
python monthly_auto_send.py --month April --year 2026
python monthly_auto_send.py --to finance@example.com --cc ops@example.com
python monthly_auto_send.py --source excel
python monthly_auto_send.py --force
```

Recommended Windows Task Scheduler setup:

1. Create a Basic Task named `CaddyCheck Monthly Invoice`.
2. Trigger: `Monthly`, every `1` month, on day `1`.
3. Start time: choose the local time you want the email to go out.
4. Action: `Start a program`.
5. Program/script: path to your Python executable.
6. Add arguments: `monthly_auto_send.py`.
7. Start in: the project folder.

Example values:

```text
Program/script: C:\Python311\python.exe
Add arguments: monthly_auto_send.py
Start in: F:\caddycheck-crm
```

Recommended first run in Task Scheduler:
- Use `monthly_auto_send.py --dry-run` first.
- Confirm the target month, invoice number, recipients, and total in the task history/logs.
- Then switch the task arguments back to `monthly_auto_send.py`.

## Orders Workflow

The CRM now supports project orders as a separate workflow from Projects.

Before using it in the shared cloud app:
- Run `migrations/create_orders.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.

How to use the Orders page:
- Open the `📦 Orders` page in the Streamlit app.
- Use `Import Orders` to upload a customer order file (`PDF`, `XLSX`, or `CSV`).
- Or use `New Order` to create an order row manually.

Tracked order fields:
- Order reference
- Project name
- Country
- Ordered cameras
- Payment month
- Install year
- Requested activation date
- Status
- Notes

Supported order statuses:
- `New`
- `Ordered`
- `In Progress`
- `Installed`
- `Active`
- `Cancelled`

Creating CRM projects from orders:
- Use `Create Missing Projects From Selected Orders` on the Orders page.
- This creates projects in the Projects list from order rows that do not yet exist as projects.

Storage behavior:
- If the `orders` table exists in Supabase, orders are stored centrally.
- If the table is missing, the app falls back to local JSON storage and shows a warning in the UI.
